# Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Tkinter.


## Usage

        git clone https://github.com/Anusha629/conways_game_of_life.git

        pip install tk


## Rules

        If a live cell has fewer than two live neighbors or more than three live neighbors, it dies (new state = 0).
        If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it survives (new state = 1).
        If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive (new state = 1).

## How to Run
        
        python3 game_of_life.py
